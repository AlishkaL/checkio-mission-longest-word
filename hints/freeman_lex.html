            Catch an idea üí°! Declare variables to keep a current longest word and its length. Split the sentence into separate words, look at every one, find its length and compare with the stored one. If the length of current word is longer - update values of variables for a current longest word and its length.

        Ok, what should I start from?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Declare two variables: for longest word with initial value of empty string; for its length with initial value 0. You are going to return the longest word at the end.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
res = ""
l = 0
...
return res

            Let's split the sentence into separate words with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp">str.split()</a> method without arguments and iterate over these words with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp">for</a> loop.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
for word in sentence.split():
    ...

    <div class="question">
        What to do with every word?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            Since you are looking for the longest one, you need to calculate the length with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_len.asp">len()</a> function.
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
l1 = len(word)
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now, if this calculated value <b class="code">l1</b> is strictly bigger then the stored one <b class="code">l</b>, you need to update variables <b class="code">res</b> and <b class="code">l</b> with new values of <b class="code">word</b> and <b class="code">l1</b>. 
        </p>
        <pre class="brush: python">
if l1 > l: res, l = word, l1
        </pre>
        <p>
            Tuple unpacking is used here. Strict comparison is needed to keep the first word of longest length.

        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>
            You just need to join all previous hints and wrap your code into function expression. Using type hints for input and output data are highly recommended.

        <p>Here is the whole solution:</p>

def longest_word(sentence: str) -> str:
    
    res = ""
    l = 0 
    for word in sentence.split():
        l1 = len(word)
        if l1 > l: res, l = word, l1

            Split the line and take maximum by length and reversed index in line.
        </p>
        <div class="spoiler">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def longest_word(line: str) -> str:

    return line and max(line.split(), key=lambda w: (len(w), -line.index(w)))
